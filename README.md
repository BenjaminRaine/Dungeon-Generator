# Dungeon-Generator
Using Binary Partitioning, a 2D Implementation of Prims Algorithm and Random Number Generation I create a more realistic looking dungeon by minimizing hallways by clustering rooms together. This is intended for D&D, general roleplay, or any other random dungeon related needs needs.
